  itemDescription: A container of nano crystaline particulate. Bonds to any metallic
    surface when current is applied. The Matrix of the submetal is penetrated and
    restructured stronger than before. This Container has been breached and you hear
    voices inside. It sounds like the voice of your mother... You've never had a
